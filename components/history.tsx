          After completing my BFA from York University, I pursued my passion for
          music and the recording arts, and completed a diploma program at the
          Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology. Following that I
          secured a position at a studio in Toronto, and worked on many album
          projects as and Audio Engineer, including a Juno Award winning album
          for Toronto Mass Choir.

          During that position, the opportunity arose to contribute to an online
          eCommerce Music web site to sell albums (physical CD's) for the
          company. A more experience developer built the initial version, while
          worked on the front-end dev and became the site maintainer.

                This web application allowed the customer to obtain and manage
                lease agreement information more easily from university/college
                students who were applying to lease properties. The app greatly
                streamlined their existing paper-based application process.

                I created a new web site for Centre Island Amusement Park, which
                required guest information and marketing details, as well as a
                fully functioning eCommerce Ticket Sales system.
              </li>
              <li className={listItem}>
                I built the eCommerce system with an integration with Moneris as
                the payment processor. Integration with Verified By VISA and
                Mastercard Secure authentication was also completed.
              </li>

                Custom receipts with dynamically generated barcodes were
                created.
              </li>
              <li className={listItem}>
                An admin tool for redeeming the tickets at the ticket booth on
                location was also created. Staff could scan the printed ticket
                barcode with a barcode scan wand.
